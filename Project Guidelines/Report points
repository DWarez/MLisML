ABSTRACT
--------
\textit{Insert here few rows (up to 5) summarizing the developed project (\underline{used model} \underline{for the cup}, validation technique, novelties if any) \dots} 


INTRODUCTION
------------
\textit{Describe/define \textit{your aim and the essential background} (in short):
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item[$\circ$] Define your aims: To explore/improve what? What are you going to show?
    \item[$\circ$] Describe (just \underline{define}) the used models, the used algorithms  etc. 
    \item[$\circ$] Describe your assumptions (if any significant).
\end{itemize}}


METHOD
------
\underline{Briefly} (short part) describe \textit{what you developed and how}:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item[-] The code (for type A implementation) or the used simulator(s) (for type B). 
        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength\itemsep{0em}
            \item[$\circ$] The used tools/libraries (if any) 
            \item[$\circ$] Software overview and the software design choices (if interesting)
            \item[$\circ$] Implementation choices (a summary): e.g. architecture/s (and numb. of layers), type of activation function/s, type of training algorithm/s, batch/on-line/mb, initialization schema/s, regularization schema/s, stop condition/s.
            \item[$\circ$] The novelties (if any) but not the standard approaches (\underline{\textit{do not}} describe the algorithms/models we already described in the lectures). Use references for the source of information. 
        \end{itemize}
        \item[-] Preprocessing procedure (if any) [details may be postponed to Section \ref{sec:experiments}]
        \item[-] \underline{Validation schema} (model selection and evaluation schema) for the Experimental part: report data splitting  TR/VL/TS (\% data for each set and/or the K values of the k-fold CV) [details may be postponed to Section \ref{sec:experiments}]
        \item[-] Type of preliminary trials pursued (often summarized by text) [details may be postponed to Section \ref{sec:experiments}]
\end{itemize}

\noindent \\ Each figure/table should be referenced as in the following, see Fig \ref{fig:myfigure}. 
Do not use figure/table without a number. Do not write “see the next figure” (which one?).
Tables and plots have always a caption. All of the Figures and Tables should be cited in order, including those in the Appendix. (which should be cited as, for example, Fig. A.1, and Table A.1).
